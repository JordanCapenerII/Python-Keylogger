# Python-Keylogger
## Description:
A keylogger is a program or device that records every user's keystroke on a computer or mobile device.
There are two different types of Keyloggers. First is a software keylogger installed in the background of
a computer without the user's knowledge. The second is a hardware keylogger connecting a physical device between the keyboard and the computer. Someone who has physical access to the computer can install this hardware into the computer.
